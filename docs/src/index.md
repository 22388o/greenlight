# Introduction

Greenlight a [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com) project offering
hosted, non-custodial, Lightning Network nodes to end-users. We take
care of the infrastructure, while you are in control of the keys.

Nodes can be registered and started in seconds, perfect for new users
that are just starting their Bitcoin and Lightning Network journey,
developers wanting to provide their users with access to the Lightning
Network, or hobbyists wanting to hack tools for their own use. It is
not our goal to capture users: once you've gained experience running a
node, you can off-board into your own infrastructure, and we'll teach
you how to do that too.
